# Gradual migration from Create React App (CRA) to Next.js

This is a sample project to demonstrate how to migrate from Create React App (CRA) to Next.js by gradually replacing CRA pages with Next.js pages.

For this purpose it uses Next.js' multi-zones approach.

It is managed by turborepo to handle all the code in one single repository and also benefit from Turbo's cache.
